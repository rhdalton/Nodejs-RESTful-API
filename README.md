# Nodejs RESTful API Example

This is a basic example of a RESTful API I created with Node.js
- Uses the Node.js Express web application framework
- Uses Node.js Joi module to validate POST, PUT data
- Handles standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests

This example app interacts with a json object, but can be changed to access a MongoDB
For this example the db object is a directory of Movies
