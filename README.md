# Nodejs-RESTful-API-Example

This is a basic example of a RESTful API in Node.js
- Uses the Node.js Express web application framework
- Handles standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- Uses Node.js Joi module to validate POST, PUT data

This example app interacts with a json object, but can be changed to access a MongoDB
For this example the db object is a directory of Movies
